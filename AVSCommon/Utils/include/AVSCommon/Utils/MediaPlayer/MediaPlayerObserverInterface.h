/**
 * A player observer will receive notifications when the player starts playing or when it stops playing a stream.
 * A pointer to the @c MediaPlayerObserverInterface needs to be provided to a @c MediaPlayer for it to notify the
 * observer.
 *
 * @warning An observer should never call a method from the observed media player while handling a callback.
 * This may cause a deadlock while trying to re-acquire a mutex.
 *
 * @warning Be aware that there is a high risk of deadlock if the observer calls media player functions while holding
 * an exclusive lock. The deadlock may happen because the call to media player functions may end up calling the same
 * observer which will try to acquire the same lock that it already has. One way to avoid this issue is by using a
 * recursive lock.

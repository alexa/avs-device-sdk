/**
 * A FocusManager takes requests to acquire and release Channels and updates the focuses of other Channels based on
 * their priorities so that the invariant that there can only be one Foreground Channel is held. The following
 * operations are provided:
 *
 * acquire Channel - clients should call the acquireChannel() method, passing in the name of the Channel they wish to
 * acquire, a pointer to the observer that they want to be notified once they get focus, and a unique interface name.
 *
 * release Channel - clients should call the releaseChannel() method, passing in the name of the Channel and the
 * observer of the Channel they wish to release.
 *
 * stop foreground Channel - clients should call the stopForegroundActivity() method.
 *
 * All of these methods will notify the observer of the Channel of focus changes via an asynchronous callback to the
 * ChannelObserverInterface##onFocusChanged() method, at which point the client should make a user observable change
 * based on the focus it receives.

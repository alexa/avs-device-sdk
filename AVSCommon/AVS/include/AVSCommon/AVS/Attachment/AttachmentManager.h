/**
 * This class allows the decoupling of attachment readers and writers from the management of attachments.
 *
 * This class is thread safe.
 *
 * A design principle of the @c Attachment class is that each attachment will have at most one reader and writer.
 *
 * Application code may query the manager for a reader and writer object at any time, and in any order.
 *
 * @note Resource management is currently implemented by a timeout approach.  This does have the following limitations:
 *
 *  @li An AttachmentReader or AttachmentWriter has reference to a shared buffer resource for the actual data.  This
 *    buffer will remain in existence until both the Reader and Writer have been destroyed.
 *  @li Therefore, application code should ensure that Readers and Writers are destroyed when no longer needed.
 *  @li The AttachmentManager will always satisfy a request to create a Reader or Writer - it will not currently
 *    enforce a maximum resource limit.
 *  @li ACSDK-254 will address this by enforcing such limits.  It should also be noted however, that a well
 *    behaving application may not observe much difference - the future implementation will forcibly close
 *    the oldest Attachment to make space for the new one.  For a system reading and writing a small set of attachments
 *    at any given time, the AttachmentManager should not need to step in and take such action.

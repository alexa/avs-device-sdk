     * This function provides a consistent way for different parts of application code to combine contextId and
     * contentId into a single string.  Clearly, both the reader and writer of a given attachment need to call this
     * function with the same two strings.
     *
     * As an example of usage, if an application has several sources of attachments, for example two audio providers,
     * then one pair of contextId / contentId strings might be: { "AudioProvider1", "Attachment1" }.  If the other
     * audio provider creates an attachment, then the pair: { "AudioProvider2", "Attachment1" } allows the
     * contextId to disambiguate what happens to be identical contentIds.
     *
     * If this function is called with one or both strings being empty, then the combine will not be performed.
     * In the case of both strings being empty, an empty string will be returned.  If only one string is non-empty,

### What is the Alexa Voice Service (AVS)?

The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) enables developers to integrate Alexa directly into their products, bringing the convenience of voice control to any connected device. AVS provides developers with access to a suite of resources to build Alexa-enabled products, including APIs, hardware development kits, software development kits, and documentation.

### What is the AVS Device SDK

The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Device SDK provides you with a set of C ++ libraries to build an Alexa Built-in product, meaning your device has direct access to cloud-based Alexa capabilities to receive voice responses instantly. You can create a wide range of devices — a smartwatch, speaker, headphones, smart TV, set-top boxes, soundbar, AV receiver, home theater hub, or a gaming console — the choice is yours.

### Release Notes and Known Issues

Feature enhancements, updates, and resolved issues from all releases are available on the [Amazon developer portal](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/avs-device-sdk/release-notes.html).

### Get Started

You can [set up the SDK](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/avs-device-sdk/quick-start-guides.html) on the following platforms:
* Ubuntu Linux
* Raspberry Pi
* macOS

### SDK Architecture

The SDK is modular and abstract. It provides [separate components](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/avs-device-sdk/overview.html#sdk-architecture) to handle necessary Alexa functionality including processing audio, maintaining persistent connections, and managing Alexa interactions. Each component exposes [Alexa APIs](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/api-overview.html) to customize your device integrations as needed. The SDK also includes a Sample App, so you can  test interactions before integration.

### Security Requirements

All Alexa products must meet the [AVS Security Requirements](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/avs-security-reqs.html). In addition, when building the AVS Device SDK, you are required to adhere to the [following security principles](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/avs-device-sdk/overview.html#security-requirements).

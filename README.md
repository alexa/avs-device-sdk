### IMPORTANT NOTE
If you are updating from v1.x to v1.4, you must update your `AlexaClientSDKConfig.json` to include a Notifications database. An updated sample is available in the quickstart guides for Ubuntu Linux, Raspberry Pi, macOS, and Generic Linux.

### What is the Alexa Voice Service (AVS)?

The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) enables developers to integrate Alexa directly into their products, bringing the convenience of voice control to any connected device. AVS provides developers with access to a suite of resources to quickly and easily build Alexa-enabled products, including APIs, hardware development kits, software development kits, and documentation.

### Overview of the AVS Device SDK

The AVS Device SDK provides C++-based (11 or later) libraries that leverage the AVS API to create device software for Alexa-enabled products. It is modular and abstracted, providing components for handling discrete functions such as speech capture, audio processing, and communications, with each component exposing the APIs that you can use and customize for your integration. It also includes a sample app, which demonstrates the interactions with AVS.

### Get Started

You can set up the SDK on the following platforms:
* [Ubuntu Linux](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/Ubuntu-Linux-Quick-Start-Guide)
* [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Quick-Start-Guide-with-Script) (Raspbian Stretch)
* [macOS](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/macOS-Quick-Start-Guide)
* [Generic Linux](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/Linux-Reference-Guide)

### SDK Architecture

This diagram illustrates the data flows between components that comprise the AVS Device SDK for C++.

![SDK Architecture Diagram](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/avs/Alexa_Device_SDK_Architecture.png)

**Audio Signal Processor (ASP)** - Third-party software that applies signal processing algorithms to both input and output audio channels. The applied algorithms are designed to produce clean audio data and include, but are not limited to acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), beam forming (fixed or adaptive), voice activity detection (VAD), and dynamic range compression (DRC). If a multi-microphone array is present, the ASP constructs and outputs a single audio stream for the array.

**Shared Data Stream (SDS)** - A single producer, multi-consumer buffer that allows for the transport of any type of data between a single writer and one or more readers. SDS performs two key tasks:

1. It passes audio data between the audio front end (or Audio Signal Processor), the wake word engine, and the Alexa Communications Library (ACL) before sending to AVS
2. It passes data attachments sent by AVS to specific capability agents via the ACL

SDS is implemented atop a ring buffer on a product-specific memory segment (or user-specified), which allows it to be used for in-process or interprocess communication. Keep in mind, the writer and reader(s) may be in different threads or processes.

**Wake Word Engine (WWE)** - Software that spots wake words in an input stream. It is comprised of two binary interfaces. The first handles wake word spotting (or detection), and the second handles specific wake word models (in this case "Alexa"). Depending on your implementation, the WWE may run on the system on a chip (SOC) or dedicated chip, like a digital signal processor (DSP).

**Audio Input Processor (AIP)** - Handles audio input that is sent to AVS via the ACL. These include on-device microphones, remote microphones, an other audio input sources.

The AIP also includes the logic to switch between different audio input sources. Only one audio input source can be sent to AVS at a given time.

**Alexa Communications Library (ACL)** - Serves as the main communications channel between a client and AVS. The ACL performs two key functions:

1. Establishes and maintains long-lived persistent connections with AVS. ACL adheres to the messaging specification detailed in [Managing an HTTP/2 Connection with AVS](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/managing-an-http-2-connection).
2. Provides message sending and receiving capabilities, which includes support JSON-formatted text, and binary audio content. For additional information, see [Structuring an HTTP/2 Request to AVS](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests).

**Alexa Directive Sequencer Library (ADSL)**: Manages the order and sequence of directives from AVS, as detailed in the [AVS Interaction Model](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/interaction-model#channels). This component manages the lifecycle of each directive, and informs the Directive Handler (which may or may not be a Capability Agent) to handle the message.

**Activity Focus Manager Library (AFML)**: Provides centralized management of audiovisual focus for the device. Focus is based on channels, as detailed in the [AVS Interaction Model](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/interaction-model#channels), which are used to govern the prioritization of audiovisual inputs and outputs.

Channels can either be in the foreground or background. At any given time, only one channel can be in the foreground and have focus. If multiple channels are active, you need to respect the following priority order: Dialog > Alerts > Content. When a channel that is in the foreground becomes inactive, the next active channel in the priority order moves into the foreground.

Focus management is not specific to Capability Agents or Directive Handlers, and can be used by non-Alexa related agents as well. This allows all agents using the AFML to have a consistent focus across a device.

**Capability Agents**: Handle Alexa-driven interactions; specifically directives and events. Each capability agent corresponds to a specific interface exposed by the AVS API. These interfaces include:

* [SpeechRecognizer](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/speechrecognizer) - The interface for speech capture.
* [SpeechSynthesizer](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/speechsynthesizer) - The interface for Alexa speech output.
* [Alerts](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/alerts) - The interface for setting, stopping, and deleting timers and alarms.
* [AudioPlayer](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/audioplayer) - The interface for managing and controlling audio playback.
* [Notifications](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/notifications) - The interface for displaying notifications indicators.
* [PlaybackController](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller) - The interface for navigating a playback queue via GUI or buttons.
* [Speaker](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/speaker) - The interface for volume control, including mute and unmute.
* [System](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system) - The interface for communicating product status/state to AVS.
* [TemplateRuntime](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/templateruntime) - The interface for rendering visual metadata.

### Release Notes and Known Issues

**Note**: Features, updates, and resolved issues from previous releases are available to view in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-client-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

v1.4.0 released 01/12/2018:

**Enhancements**
* Added the Notifications Capability Agent. This allows a client to receive notification indicators from Alexa.
* Added support for the `SoftwareInfo` event. This code is triggered in the `SampleApp` by providing a positive decimal integer as the "firmwareVersion" value in "sampleApp" object of the `AlexaClientSDKConfig.json`. The reported firmware version can be updated after starting the `SampleApp` by calling `SoftwareInfoSender::setFirmwareVersion()`. This code path can be exercised in the `SampleApp` with the new command: `f`.
* Added unit tests for Alerts.
* The GStreamer-based pipeline allows for the configuration of `MediaPlayer` output based on information provided in `Config`.
* Playlist streaming now uses a `BLOCKING` writer, which improves streaming efficiency.

**Bug Fixes**
* Fixed bug where `SpeechSynthesizer` would not stop playback when a state change timeout was encountered.
* Fixed the `SampleApplication` destructor to avoid segfaults if the object is not constructed correctly.
* Fixed bug where `AudioPlayer` would erroneously call `executeStop()` in `cancelDirective()`.
* [Issue 396](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/396) - Fixed bug for compilation error with GCC7 in `AVSCommon/SDKInterfaces/include/AVSCommon/SDKInterfaces/Audio/AlertsAudioFactoryInterface.h`
* [Issue 384](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/384) - Fixed bug that caused `AuthServer.py` to crash.
* Fixed bug where a long delay was encountered after pausing and resuming a large Audible chapter.
* Fixed bug that caused named timers and reminders to loop for an additional `loopCount` .
* Fixed memory corruption bug in `MessageInterpreter`.
* Fixed illegal memory accesses in `MediaPlayer` logging.

**Known Issues**
* The `ACL` may encounter issues if audio attachments are received but not consumed.
* Display Cards for Kindle don't render.
* If using the GStreamer-based `MediaPlayer` implementation, after muting and un-muting an audio item, the next item in the queue will begin playing rather than continuing playback of the originally muted audio item.
* `SpeechSynthesizerState` currently uses `GAINING_FOCUS` and `LOSING_FOCUS` as a workaround for handling intermediate state. These states may be removed in a future release.
* Music playback doesn't immediately stop when a user barges-in on iHeartRadio.

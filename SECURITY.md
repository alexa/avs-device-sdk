### Security Policy for Device SDKs
Amazon has updated the AVS API to add a new consent screen during device registration for new users if the device has not been certified by Amazon. Once the device has completed the testing process including obtaining a security assessment from Authorized Security Lab and receiving an Alexa Built-in badge, this consent screen will be removed and developers will be able to offer the full Alexa experience on their Alexa Built-in devices.

Important note on SoftHSM library
*********************************
This module is intended for experimentation purposes only. We strongly discourage the use of SoftHSM in a production
environment because it might provide a false sense of additional security. The resulting configuration doesn't provide
any actual security benefits. The keys stored in SoftHSM are not stored more securely.than any other means of secrets
storage in the Greengrass environment.
The purpose of this module it to allow you to learn about the PKCS#11 specification and do initial testing of your
software if you plan to use a real hardware-based HSM in the future.
You must test your future hardware implementation separately and completely before any production usage because there
might be differences between PKCS#11 implementation provided in SoftHSM and a hardware-based implementation.

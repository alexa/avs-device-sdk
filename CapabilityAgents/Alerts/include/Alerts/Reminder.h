 * A reminder class.  This represents an alert which the user wishes to activate at a specific point in time,
 * which they specify as that absolute time point, rather than an offset from the current time.
 *
 * The user expectation is that the activation of the reminder will include custom assets (if the device is connected
 * to the internet), such as Alexa telling the user something specific with respect to the reminder being set.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * "Alexa, remind me to walk the dog at 10am".
 * 10am : Alexa will say "This is your 10am reminder to walk the dog."

<p><b>Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
<li>New optional configuration for <a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/blob/v1.10.0/Integration/AlexaClientSDKConfig.json#L154">EqualizerController</a>. The EqualizerController interface allows you to adjust equalizer settings on your product, such as decibel (dB) levels and modes.</li>
<li>Added reference implementation of the EqualizerController for GStreamer-based (MacOS, Linux, and Raspberry Pi) and OpenSL ES-based (Android) MediaPlayers. Note: In order to use with Android, it must support OpenSL ES.</li>
<li>New optional configuration for the <a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/blob/v1.10.0/Integration/AlexaClientSDKConfig.json#L144">TemplateRuntime display card value</a>.</li>
<li>A configuration file generator script, <code>genConfig.sh</code> is now included with the SDK in the <b>tools/Install</b> directory. <code>genConfig.sh</code> and it's associated arguments populate <code>AlexaClientSDKConfig.json</code> with the data required to authorize with LWA.</li>
<li>Added Bluetooth A2DP source and AVRCP target support for Linux.</li>
<li>Added Alexa for Business (A4B) support, which includes support for handling the new <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/system.html#revokeauth">RevokeAuthorization</a> directive in the Settings interface. A new CMake option has been added to enable A4B within the SDK, <code>-DA4B</code>.</li>
<li>Added locale support for IT and ES.</li>
<li>The Alexa Communication Library (ACL), <code>CBLAUthDelegate</code>, and sample app have been enhanced to detect de-authorization using the new <code>z</code> command.</li>
<li>Added <code>ExternalMediaPlayerObserver</code>, which receives notification of player state, track, and username changes.</li>
<li><code>HTTP2ConnectionInterface</code> was factored out of <code>HTTP2Transport</code> to enable unit testing of <code>HTTP2Transport</code> and re-use of <code>HTTP2Connection</code> logic.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug Fixes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in which <code>ExternalMediaPlayer</code> adapter playback wasn't being recognized by AVS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/973">Issue 973</a> - Fixed issues related to <code>AudioPlayer</code> where progress reports were being sent out of order or with incorrect offsets.</li>
<li>An <code>EXPECTING</code>, state has been added to <code>DialogUXState</code> in order to handle <code>EXPECT_SPEECH</code> state for hold-to-talk devices.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/948">Issue 948</a> - Fixed a bug in which the sample app was stuck in a listening state.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where there was a delay between receiving a <code>DeleteAlert</code> directive, and deleting the alert.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/839">Issue 839</a> - Fixed an issue where speech was being truncated due to the <code>DialogUXStateAggregator</code> transitioning between a <code>THINKING</code> and <code>IDLE</code> state.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in which the <code>AudioPlayer</code> attempted to play when it wasn't in the <code>FOREGROUND</code> focus.</li>
<li><code>CapabilitiesDelegateTest</code> now works on Android.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/950">Issue 950</a> - Improved Android Media Player audio quality.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/issues/908">Issue 908</a> - Fixed compile error on g++ 7.x in which includes were missing.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Known Issues</b></p>
<ul>
<li>On GCC 8+, issues related to <code>-Wclass-memaccess</code> will trigger warnings. However, this won't cause the build to fail, and these warnings can be ignored.</li>
<li>In order to use Bluetooth source and sink PulseAudio, you must manually load and unload PulseAudio modules after the SDK starts.</li>
<li>When connecting a new device to AVS, <em>currently connected devices must be manually disconnected</em>. For example, if a user says "Alexa, connect my phone", and an Alexa-enabled speaker is already connected, there is no indication to the user a device is already connected.</li>
<li>The <code>ACL</code> may encounter issues if audio attachments are received but not consumed.</li>
<li><code>SpeechSynthesizerState</code> currently uses <code>GAINING_FOCUS</code> and <code>LOSING_FOCUS</code> as a workaround for handling intermediate state. These states may be removed in a future release.</li>
<li>The Alexa app doesn't always indicate when a device is successfully connected via Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Connecting a product to streaming media via Bluetooth will sometimes stop media playback within the source application. Resuming playback through the source application or toggling next/previous will correct playback.</li>
<li>When a source device is streaming silence via Bluetooth, the Alexa app indicates that audio content is streaming.</li>
<li>The Bluetooth agent assumes that the Bluetooth adapter is always connected to a power source. Disconnecting from a power source during operation is not yet supported.</li>
<li>On some products, interrupted Bluetooth playback may not resume if other content is locally streamed.</li>
<li><code>make integration</code> is currently not available for Android. In order to run integration tests on Android, you'll need to manually upload the test binary file along with any input file. At that point, the adb can be used to run the integration tests.</li>
<li>On Raspberry Pi running Android Things with HDMI output audio, beginning of speech is truncated when Alexa responds to user TTS.</li>
<li>When the sample app is restarted and network connection is lost, Alerts don't play.</li>
<li>When network connection is lost, lost connection status is not returned via local TTS.</li>

<li>If an unrecoverable authorization error is encountered the sample app may crash on shutdown.</li>
<li>If a non-CBL <code>clientId</code> is included in the <code>deviceInfo</code> section of <code>AlexaClientSDKConfig.json</code>, the error will be reported as an unrecoverable authorization error, rather than a more specific error.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[1.6.0] - 2018-03-08</h3>
<p><b>Enhancements</b></p><ul>
<li><code>rapidJson</code> is now included with "make install".</li>

<p><b>Enhancements</b></p><ul>
<li>Added the Notifications Capability Agent. This allows a client to receive notification indicators from Alexa.</li>
<li>Added support for the <code>SoftwareInfo</code> event. This code is triggered in the <code>SampleApp</code> by providing a positive decimal integer as the "firmwareVersion" value in "sampleApp" object of the <code>AlexaClientSDKConfig.json</code>. The reported firmware version can be updated after starting the <code>SampleApp</code> by calling <code>SoftwareInfoSender::setFirmwareVersion()</code>. This code path can be exercised in the <code>SampleApp</code> with the new command: <code>f</code>.</li>
<li>Added unit tests for Alerts.</li>
<li>The GStreamer-based pipeline allows for the configuration of <code>MediaPlayer</code> output based on information provided in <code>Config</code>.</li>
<li>Playlist streaming now uses a <code>BLOCKING</code> writer, which improves streaming efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>[1.3.0] - 2017-12-08</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Enhancements</b><ul>
<li>ContextManager now passes the namespace/name of the desired state to StateProviderInterface::provideState(). This is helpful when a single StateProvider object provides multiple states, and needs to know which one ContextManager is asking for.</li>

<li>Added default alert and timer audio data to the SDK SampleApp. There is no longer a requirement to download these audio files and configure them in the json configuration file.</li>
<li>Added support in SDS Reader and AttachmentReader for seeking into the future. This allows a reader to move to an index which has not yet arrived in the SDS and poll/block until it arrives.</li>
<li>Added support for blocking Writers in the SharedDataStream class.</li>
<li>Changed the default status code sent by MessageRequestObserverInterface::onSendCompleted() to SERVER_OTHER_ERROR, and mapped HTTP code 500 to SERVER_INTERNAL_ERROR_V2.</li>

<li>Added <code>SpeechSynthesizer</code>, an implementation of the <code>SpeechRecognizer</code> capability agent.</li>
<li>Implemented a reference <code>MediaPlayer</code> based on <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> for audio playback.</li>
<li>Added <code>MediaPlayerInterface</code> that allows you to implement your own media player.</li>
<li>Updated <code>ACL</code> to support asynchronous receipt of audio attachments from AVS.</li>
<li>Bug Fixes:<ul>
<li>Some intermittent unit test failures were fixed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Known Issues:<ul>
<li><code>ACL</code>'s asynchronous receipt of audio attachments may manage resources poorly in scenarios where attachments are received but not consumed.</li>
<li>When an <code>AttachmentReader</code> does not deliver data for prolonged periods <code>MediaPlayer</code> may not resume playing the delayed audio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.3.0] - 2017-05-17</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added the <code>CapabilityAgent</code> base class that is used to build capability agent implementations.</li>
<li>Added <code>ContextManager</code>, a component that allows multiple capability agents to store and access state. These Events include <code>Context</code>, which is used to communicate the state of each capability agent to AVS in the following Events:<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/speechrecognizer#recognize"><code>Recognize</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#playcommandissued"><code>PlayCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#pausecommandissued"><code>PauseCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#nextcommandissued"><code>NextCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#previouscommandissued"><code>PreviousCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system#synchronizestate"><code>SynchronizeState</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system#exceptionencountered"><code>ExceptionEncountered</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added <code>SharedDataStream</code> (SDS) to asynchronously communicate data between a local reader and writer.</li>
<li>Added <code>AudioInputProcessor</code> (AIP), an implementation of a <code>SpeechRecognizer</code> capability agent.</li>
<li>Added WakeWord Detector (WWD), which recognizes keywords in audio streams. [0.3.0] implements a wrapper for KITT.ai.</li>
<li>Added a new implementation of <code>AttachmentManager</code> and associated classes for use with SDS.</li>
<li>Updated <code>ACL</code> to support asynchronously sending audio to AVS.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.2.1] - 2017-05-03</h3>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the configuration file <code>AuthDelegate.config</code> with <code>AlexaClientSDKConfig.json</code>.</li>
<li>Added the ability to specify a <code>CURLOPT_CAPATH</code> value to be used when libcurl is used by ACL and AuthDelegate. See See Appendix C in the README for details.</li>
<li>Changes to ADSL interfaces:<ul>
<li>The [0.2.0] interface for registering directive handlers (<code>DirectiveSequencer::setDirectiveHandlers()</code>) was problematic because it canceled the ongoing processing of directives and dropped further directives until it completed. The revised API makes the operation immediate without canceling or dropping any handling. However, it does create the possibility that <code>DirectiveHandlerInterface</code> methods <code>preHandleDirective()</code> and <code>handleDirective()</code> may be called on different handlers for the same directive.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveSequencerInterface::setDirectiveHandlers()</code> was replaced by <code>addDirectiveHandlers()</code> and <code>removeDirectiveHandlers()</code>.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveHandlerInterface::shutdown()</code> was replaced with <code>onDeregistered()</code>.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveHandlerInterface::preHandleDirective()</code> now takes a <code>std::unique_ptr</code> instead of a <code>std::shared_ptr</code> to <code>DirectiveHandlerResultInterface</code>.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveHandlerInterface::handleDirective()</code> now returns a bool indicating if the handler recognizes the <code>messageId</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug fixes:<ul>
<li>ACL and AuthDelegate now require TLSv1.2.</li>
<li><code>onDirective()</code> now sends <code>ExceptionEncountered</code> for unhandled directives.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveSequencer::shutdown()</code> no longer sends <code>ExceptionEncountered()</code> for queued directives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.2.0] - 2017-03-27 (patch)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added memory profiling for ACL and ADSL. See Appendix A in the README.</li>
<li>Added a command to build the API documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.2.0] - 2017-03-09</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>Alexa Directive Sequencer Library</code> (ADSL) and <code>Alexa Focus Manager Library</code> (AMFL).</li>
<li>CMake build types and options have been updated.</li>
<li>Documentation for libcurl optimization included.</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.1.0] - 2017-02-10</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initial release of the <code>Alexa Communications Library</code> (ACL), a component which manages network connectivity with AVS, and <code>AuthDelegate</code>, a component which handles user authorization with AVS. </li>
</ul>

<li>Added support for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/avs-device-sdk/sdk-interaction-model.html">Audio Focus Manager Library (AFML) Multi Activity</a>. This interface enhances the behavior of a device so it can handle more than one Activity per Channel.</li>
<li>Added the <code>obfuscatePrivateData</code> logging method to help remove certain data from logs.</li>
<li>Updated <code>MediaPlayerObserverInterface</code> to include metadata about playback states.</li>
<li>Added SDK extension point. You can integrate CMake projects into the SDK without cloning those projects into a subdirectory.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug fixes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Mac/OSX issue that caused an unresponsive Sample App when not connected to the internet.</li>
<li>Fixed issue that prevented sample app from exiting various states.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>UIManager</code> issue that caused an error in the logs when the device with built without the wake word enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed volume issue that caused timers to ascend in volume when setting up ascending alarms.</li>
<li>Fixed alert volume issue that caused any changes to the alert volume to notify observers.</li>
<li>Fixed EQ issue where changes to the EQ band levels didn't notify observers.</li>
<li>Fixed Bluetooth bug that caused short notification sounds from a connected phone to stop audio playback on the device.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Known Issues</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Build errors can occur on the Raspberry Pi due to incorrect linking of the atomic library. A suggested workaround is to add the following <code>set(CMAKE_CXX_LINK_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_LINK_FLAGS} -latomic")</code> to the top most CMake file.</li>
<li>The WebVTT dependency required for <code>captions</code> isn't supported for Windows/Android.</li>
<li>Exiting from the setting option takes you back to the Options Menu directly. It doesn't provide a message to indicate that you're back in the main menu.</li>
<li>Failing Unit Tests and AIP Unit tests are disabled on Windows</li>
<li><code>AudioInputProcessor</code> unit tests don't build on Windows when with the <code>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG</code> cmake parameter.</li>
<li>Music playback history isn't displayed in the Alexa app for certain account and device types.</li>
<li>When using Gnu Compiler Collection 8+ (GCC 8+), <code>-Wclass-memaccess</code> triggers warnings. You can ignore these, they don't cause the build to fail.</li>
<li>Android error <code>libDefaultClient.so not found</code> might occur. Resolve this by upgrading to ADB version 1.0.40.</li>
<li>If a device loses a network connection, the lost connection status isn't returned though local TTS.</li>
<li>ACL encounters issues if it receives audio attachments but doesn't consume them.</li>
<li>Media streamed through Bluetooth might abruptly stop. To restart playback, resume the media in the source application or toggle next/previous.</li>
<li>If a connected Bluetooth device is inactive, the Alexa app might indicates that audio is playing.</li>
<li>The Bluetooth agent assumes that the Bluetooth adapter is always connected to a power source. Disconnecting from a power source during operation isn't yet supported.</li>
<li>When using some products, interrupted Bluetooth playback might not resume if other content is locally streamed.</li>
<li><code>make integration</code> isn't available for Android. To run Android integration tests, manually upload the test binary and input file and run ADB.</li>
<li>Alexa might truncate the beginning of speech when responding to text-to-speech (TTS) user events. This only impacts Raspberry Pi devices running Android Things with HDMI output audio.</li>
<li>A reminder TTS message doesn't play if the sample app restarts and loses a network connection. Instead, the default alarm tone plays twice.</li>
<li><code>ServerDisconnectIntegratonTest</code> tests are disabled until they are updated to reflect new service behavior.</li>
<li>The <code>DirectiveSequencerTest.test_handleBlockingThenImmediatelyThenNonBockingOnSameDialogId</code> test fails intermittently.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.16.0 - October 25 2019</h3>
<p>**Enhancements** </p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for <a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/SpeechSynthesizer-Interface-v1.2">SpeechSynthesizer version 1.2</a> which includes the new <code>playBehaviour</code> directive.</li>
<li>Added support for pre-buffering in the <a href="https://alexa.github.io/avs-device-sdk/classalexa_client_s_d_k_1_1capability_agents_1_1audio_player_1_1_audio_player.html"><code>AudioPlayer</code></a> Capability Agent. You can optionally choose the number of instances <a href="https://alexa.github.io/avs-device-sdk/namespacealexa_client_s_d_k_1_1avs_common_1_1utils_1_1media_player.html"><code>MediaPlayer</code></a> uses in the <a href="https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/blob/master/Integration/AlexaClientSDKConfig.json">AlexaClientSDKconfig.json</a>. <b>Important:</b> the contract for <a href="https://alexa.github.io/avs-device-sdk/classalexa_client_s_d_k_1_1avs_common_1_1utils_1_1media_player_1_1_media_player_interface.html"><code>MediaPlayerInterface</code></a> has changed. You must now make sure that the <code>SourceId</code> value returned by <code>setSource()</code> is unique across all instances.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://alexa.github.io/avs-device-sdk/classalexa_client_s_d_k_1_1capability_agents_1_1audio_player_1_1_audio_player.html"><code>AudioPlayer</code></a> Capability Agent is now licensed under the Amazon Software License instead of the Apache Software License.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug Fixes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Android issue that caused the build script to ignore <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code>. This sometimes caused the build to use a preinstalled dependency instead of the specific version downloaded by the Android script. For example openssl).</li>
<li>Fixed Android issue that prevented the Sample app from running at the same time as other applications using the microphone. Android doesn't inherently allow two applications to use the microphone. Pressing the mute button now temporarily stops Alexa from accessing the microphone.</li>
<li>Added 'quit' (– q) to the settings sub menu.</li>
<li>Fixed outdated dependencies issue in the Windows install script.</li>
<li>Fixed reminders issue that caused Notification LEDs to stay on, even after dismissing the alert.</li>
</ul>
<h3>v1.15.0 released 09/25/2019:</h3>
<p><b>Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>SystemSoundPlayer</code> to <a href="https://alexa.github.io/avs-device-sdk/namespacealexa_client_s_d_k_1_1application_utilities.html">ApplicationUtilities</a>. <code>SystemSoundPlayer</code> is a new class that plays pre-defined sounds. Sounds currently supported include the wake word notification and the end of speech tone. This change is internal and you don't need to update your code.</li>
<li>Removed <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/042be85c-5a62-4c55-a18d-d7a82cf394df/esp-moves-to-the-cloud-for-alexa-enabled-devices">Echo Spatial Perception (ESP)</a> functionality from the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) device SDK. Make sure you download and test your devices using the new AVS SDK sample app. If you're using an older version of the sample app, manually remove any references to ESP or errors occur during compile.</li>
<li>Added <code>onNotificationReceived</code> to <code>NotificationsObserverInterface</code>. <code>onNotificationReceived</code> broadcasts when <code>NotificationsObserverInterface</code> receives a new notification, instead of only sending the indicator state. This is important if you support a feature that requires a distinct signal for each notification received. See <a href="https://alexa.github.io/avs-device-sdk/classalexa_client_s_d_k_1_1avs_common_1_1sdk_interfaces_1_1_notifications_observer_interface.html">NotificationsObserverInterface</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Added support for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/system.html#localecombinations">Multilingual Mode</a>. With this enabled, Alexa automatically detects what language a user speaks by analyzing the spoken wake word and proceeding utterances. Once Alexa identifies the language, all corresponding responses are in the same language. The current supported language pairs are:<ul>
<li><code>[ "en-US", "es-US" ]</code></li>
<li><code>[ "es-US", "en-US" ]</code></li>
<li><code>[ "en-IN", "hi-IN" ]</code></li>
<li><code>[ "hi-IN", "en-IN" ]</code></li>
<li><code>[ "en-CA", "fr-CA" ]</code></li>
<li><code>[ "fr-CA", "en-CA" ]</code> <br />
 <b>IMPORTANT</b>: Specify the locales your device supports in the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/system.html#localecombinations">localeCombinations</a> field in AlexaClientSDKConfig.json. This field can't be empty. If you don't set these values, the sample app fails to run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added two new system settings, <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/system.html#settimezone">Timezone</a> and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/system.html#locales">Locale</a>.<ul>
<li>Timezone: For example, you can set the <code>defaultTimezone</code> to <code>America/Vancouver</code>. If you don't set a value, <code>GMT</code> is set as the default value. If you set a new timezone, make sure that your AVS system settings and default timezone stay in sync. To handle this, use the new class <code>SystemTimeZoneInterface</code>. See <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/system.html#settimezone">System Interface &gt; SetTimeZone</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Locale: For example, you can set <code>defaultLocale</code> to <code>en-GB</code>, instead of the default <code>en-US</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/speechrecognizer.html">SpeechRecognizer</a> interface now supports the following functionalities.<ul>
<li>Change wake word (<code>Alexa</code> supported for now).</li>
<li>Toggle start of request tone on/off.</li>
<li>Toggle End of request tone on/off.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deprecated the <a href="https://alexa.github.io/avs-device-sdk/classalexa_client_s_d_k_1_1avs_common_1_1avs_1_1_capability_agent.html">CapabilityAgents</a> <code>Settings{…}</code> library. <code>Settings {…}</code> now maps to an interface that's no longer supported. You might need to update your code to handle these changes. Read <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/per-interface-settings.html">Settings Interface</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Added support for three new locals: Spanish - United States (ES_US), Hindi - India (HI_IN), and Brazilian - Portuguese (PT_BR).</li>
<li>Linked the atomic library to the sample app to prevent build errors on Raspberry Pi.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug Fixes</b></p>

<li>Fixed Windows install script that caused the sample app build to fail - removed pip, flask, requests, and commentjson dependencies from the mingw.sh helper script.</li>
<li>Fixed issue: notifications failed to sync upon device initialization. For example, let's say you had two devices - one turned on and the other turned off. After clearing the notification on the first device, it still showed up on the second device after turning it on.</li>
<li>Fixed issue: barging in on a reminder caused it to stick in an inconsistent state, blocking subsequent reminders. For example, if a reminder was going off and you interrupted it, the reminder would get persist indefinitely. You could schedule future reminders, but they wouldn't play. Saying “Alexa stop” or rebooting the device fixed the “stuck” reminder.</li>

<h3>[1.2.0] - 2017-10-27</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Enhancements</b><ul>
<li>Updated MediaPlayer to solve stability issues</li>
<li>All capability agents were refined to work with the updated MediaPlayer</li>
<li>Added the TemplateRuntime capability agent</li>
<li>Added the SpeakerManager capability agent</li>
<li>Added a configuration option ("sampleApp":"endpoint") that allows the endpoint that SampleApp connects to to be specified without changing code or rebuilding</li>
<li>Added very verbose capture of libcurl debug information</li>
<li>Added an observer interface to observer audio state changes from AudioPlayer</li>
<li>Added support for StreamMetadataExtracted Event. Stream tags found in the stream are represented in JSON and sent to AVS</li>
<li>Added to the SampleApp a simple GuiRenderer as an observer to the TemplateRuntime Capability Agent</li>
<li>Moved shared libcurl functionality to AVSCommon/Utils</li>
<li>Added a CMake option to exclude tests from the "make all" build. Use "cmake &lt;absolute-path-to-source&gt;
 -DACSDK_EXCLUDE_TEST_FROM_ALL=ON" to enable it. When this option is enabled "make unit" and "make integration" still could be used to build and run the tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Bug fixes</b>:<ul>
<li>Previously scheduled alerts now play following a restart</li>
<li>General stability fixes</li>
<li>Bug fix for CertifiedSender blocking forever if the network goes down while it's trying to send a message to AVS</li>
<li>Fixes for known issue of Alerts integration tests fail: AlertsTest.UserLongUnrelatedBargeInOnActiveTimer and AlertsTest.handleOneTimerWithVocalStop</li>
<li>Attempting to end a tap-to-talk interaction with the tap-to-talk button wouldn't work</li>
<li>SharedDataStream could encounter a race condition due to a combination of a blocking Reader and a Writer closing before writing any data</li>
<li>Bug-fix for the ordering of notifications within alerts scheduling. This fixes the issue where a local-stop on an alert would also stop a subsequent alert if it were to begin without delay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Known Issues</b></li>
<li>Capability agent for Notifications is not included in this release</li>
<li>Inconsistent playback behavior when resuming content ("Alexa, pause." / "Alexa, resume."). Specifically, handling playback offsets, which causes the content to play from the start. This behavior is also occasionally seen with "Next" / "Previous".</li>
<li><code>ACL</code>'s asynchronous receipt of audio attachments may manage resources poorly in scenarios where attachments are received but not consumed.</li>
<li>Music playback failures may result in an error Text to Speech being rendered repeatedly</li>
<li>Reminders and named timers don't sound when there is no connection</li>
<li>GUI cards don't show for Kindle</li>
</ul>

<h3>[0.3.0] - 2017-05-17</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added the <code>CapabilityAgent</code> base class that is used to build capability agent implementations.</li>
<li>Added <code>ContextManager</code>, a component that allows multiple capability agents to store and access state. These Events include <code>Context</code>, which is used to communicate the state of each capability agent to AVS in the following Events:<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/speechrecognizer#recognize"><code>Recognize</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#playcommandissued"><code>PlayCommandIssued</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/playbackcontroller#pausecommandissued"><code>PauseCommandIssued</code></a></li>

<li>Replaced the configuration file <code>AuthDelegate.config</code> with <code>AlexaClientSDKConfig.json</code>.</li>
<li>Added the ability to specify a <code>CURLOPT_CAPATH</code> value to be used when libcurl is used by ACL and AuthDelegate. See See Appendix C in the README for details.</li>
<li>Changes to ADSL interfaces:<ul>
<li>The [0.2.0] interface for registering directive handlers (<code>DirectiveSequencer::setDirectiveHandlers()</code>) was problematic because it canceled the ongoing processing of directives and dropped further directives until it completed. The revised API makes the operation immediate without canceling or dropping any handling. However, it does create the possibility that <code>DirectiveHandlerInterface</code> methods <code>preHandleDirective()</code> and <code>handleDirective()</code> may be called on different handlers for the same directive.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveSequencerInterface::setDirectiveHandlers()</code> was replaced by <code>addDirectiveHandlers()</code> and <code>removeDirectiveHandlers()</code>.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveHandlerInterface::shutdown()</code> was replaced with <code>onDeregistered()</code>.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveHandlerInterface::preHandleDirective()</code> now takes a <code>std::unique_ptr</code> instead of a <code>std::shared_ptr</code> to <code>DirectiveHandlerResultInterface</code>.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveHandlerInterface::handleDirective()</code> now returns a bool indicating if the handler recognizes the <code>messageId</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug fixes:<ul>
<li>ACL and AuthDelegate now require TLSv1.2.</li>
<li><code>onDirective()</code> now sends <code>ExceptionEncountered</code> for unhandled directives.</li>
<li><code>DirectiveSequencer::shutdown()</code> no longer sends <code>ExceptionEncountered()</code> for queued directives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>[0.2.0] - 2017-03-27 (patch)</h3>

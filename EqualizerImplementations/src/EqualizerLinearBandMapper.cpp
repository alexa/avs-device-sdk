         * Case: AVS has less or the same number of bands than target
         * Band values
         * The idea is that we distribute our X AVS band values among X+ target band values.
         * Let's consider the following:
         * Values provided for three bands: A, B, C. Output has 5 bands: a, b, c, d, e. What we try to do is to
         * distribute three values onto 5 bands. We do a rough approximation here:
         * A  AB B  BC C
         * a  b  c  d  e
         *
         * Where AB and BC is an average between two.
         *
         * For the case of 3 to 10 mapping that would be:
         *
         * A  A  A  AB B  B  BC C  C  C
         * a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j
         *
         * This is how it works:
         * We have ACC(accumulator) = 10 output bands and INP = 3 input bands. SBand - source band iterator,
         * TBand - target band iterator
         *
         * ACC - INP = 10 - 3 = 7 : no overflow, we map SBand (A) to a TBand (a) and got to next TBand (b)
         * ACC - INP = 7 - 3 = 4 : no overflow, we map SBand (A) to a TBand (b) and got to next TBand (c)
         * ACC - INP = 4 - 3 = 1 : no overflow, we map SBand (A) to a TBand (c) and got to next TBand (d)
         * ACC - INP = 1 - 3 = -2 : we've got overflow. In case of overflow we use average value between current and
         * next SBand: (A + B) / 2 and map it to current TBand (d) and increase TBand (e). Then we reset
         * the ACC: ACC += 10 = 8. Since ACC reached zero or below we increase SBand to next one (B).
         * ACC - INP = 8 - 3 = 5 : no overflow, we map SBand (B) to a TBand (e) and got to next TBand (f)
         * ACC - INP = 5 - 3 = 2 : no overflow, we map SBand (B) to a TBand (f) and got to next TBand (g)
         * ACC - INP = 2 - 3 = -1 : overflow again: ACC += 10 = 9, TBand(g) = [SBand + (SBand++)] / 2 = (B + C) / 2,
         * TBand++, SBand++
         * ACC - INP = 9 - 3 = 6 : no overflow, we map SBand (C) to a TBand (g) and got to next TBand (h)
         * ACC - INP = 6 - 3 = 3 : no overflow, we map SBand (C) to a TBand (h) and got to next TBand (i)
         * ACC - INP = 3 - 3 = 0 : no overflow, we map SBand (C) to a TBand (i) and we mapped all the values. Fin.
         * On the last step we see that ACC reached zero, this means that we've done with the SBand and should go to a
         * next one, however since there was no overflow we do not use average.
